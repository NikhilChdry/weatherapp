# weatherapp

I built and deployed a full-stack Weather Forecasting web application using Spring Boot.
The backend consumes a third-party weather API securely using environment variables, exposes REST endpoints, and serves a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application is Dockerized and deployed on Render with proper production configuration, including dynamic ports and secure secret management.
